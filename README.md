#Rubber stopper

This is a mold for the rubber stopper.  The generated STLs should work with the 25mm tubes.  For the smaller centrifuge tubes you'll need to edit the '''tube_id''' parameter in mold.scad and rerun '''render.bat'''

###Quick instructions
Print both parts.  Screw together with M3 screws.  put 3x 2mm OD stainless tubes into the holes (one 9cm the others 4.5cm).  Pour in 2 part silicone.
